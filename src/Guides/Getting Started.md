# Getting Started
---

## Before you begin

You should have access to an AODocs instance and understand some  [AODocs](/docs/aodocs-staging.altirnao.com/1/c/Fundamentals/Basics%20of%20AODocs) fundamentals, as well as some basic concepts underlying [AODocs APIs](/docs/aodocs-staging.altirnao.com/1/c/Basics%20of%20AODocs%20APIs) (and the RESTful APIs in general).

## Using the API

To ease into the world of API calls and responses, you can spend some time playing around with the [API Explorer](/docs/aodocs-staging.altirnao.com/1/routes/document/v1/%7BdocumentId%7D/get).  To make it even easier, you can try it using the individual methods in the [Managing AODocs data](/docs/aodocs-staging.altirnao.com/1/c/Fundamentals/Overview) section.  They are arranged in that sequence to get you comfortable with the concepts of manipulating AODocs resources.

Or you can dive right into the methods and schemas in the [Reference](/docs/aodocs-staging.altirnao.com/1/overview).  To flesh out the succinct approach of the reference documentation, you can read up more on AODocs resources and APIs of note in their respective sections.

Additionally, you can explore the Errors/Troubleshooting/Best practices/Performance improvement sections get a better understanding of what's around the edges of the mainstream use cases.

But the easiest way to start is to use the API Explorer to follow the sequence of methods in the Managing AODocs data section.  Here's to learning new and useful things!
