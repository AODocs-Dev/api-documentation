# Overview

Just like _manually_ with the AODocs UI, AODocs APIs let you _programmatically_ access, manage, and configure AODocs objects and their associated metadata, including libraries, classes, documents, attachments, and properties.

The APIs also let you interact indirectly with some AODocs-related [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-sdk) functionality, including some mediated access to files and folders in Drive.

Here in the *Key concepts* section you can read more about [basic AODocs concepts](/docs/aodocs-staging.altirnao.com/1/c/Fundamentals/Basic%20of%20AODocs) and about how you can leverage [the fundamentals of AODocs APIs](/docs/aodocs-staging.altirnao.com/1/c/Fundamentals/Basic%20of%20AODocs%20APIs) to accomplish your goals.
