# Introduction: Creating new AODocs documents

In AODocs, you can create new documents with either just a single attachment (TF/SF/DMS), or any number of attachments including zero (DMS-only).

To create AODocs documents with and without attachments, follow these steps:

* [Get the specific document you've created](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_xHBm2TSTJU7u3eL1BNo0thYiFlQPGDD3cLTN_ZemrA/edit#heading=h.g9k67owiq7yi)
