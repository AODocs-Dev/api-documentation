<p>In order to have some test files and folders to work with, open up your <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> and create a Drive folder. Upload or create some files beside it as well as inside it.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what that might look like:</p>
<p><img src="/img/drive-new-folder.png" alt="drive-new-folder" /></p>
<hr />
<p><img src="/img/drive-new-file.png" alt="drive-new-file" /></p>
<h2>Folder ID</h2>
<p>In Drive, files and folders are identified by their individual IDs. When the URL says something like <code>/drive/folders/<strong>1HczxnMexotWE3H9z8aebZepvkla60UEzz</strong></code>, the long string of numbers and letters refers to the current Drive <strong>folder ID</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="/img/folder-id-in-url-1.png" alt="folder-id-in-url-1" /></p>
<p><img src="/img/folder-id-in-url-2.png" alt="folder-id-in-url-2" /></p>
<p>Make note of the <strong>Drive folder ID</strong> in the URL for later.</p>
<h2>File ID</h2>
<p>To get the URL to display the <strong>file</strong> ID of the <strong>file</strong> that's currently open, click on the More options&quot; menu (<strong>⁝</strong>), then on &quot;Open in new window&quot;:</p>
<p><img src="/img/file-id-open-in-new-window-menu.png" alt="file-id-open-in-new-window-menu.png" /></p>
<p>Now the URL lists the Drive <strong>file</strong> ID (as opposed to <strong>folder</strong> ID):</p>
<p><img src="/img/file-id-in-ui.png" alt="file-id-in-ui" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>⭑   <strong>Note</strong>: Certain Drive files such as Google Forms require an additional step of clicking on <code>Edit</code> (pencil icon usually in the bottom right of the page) and open the file in yet another view. Only then does the URL display the proper file ID.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make note of the <strong>Drive file ID</strong>: it and the <strong>AODocs document ID</strong> are the two most critical and commonly used pieces of identifying information in the <strong>AODocs API</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⭑   <strong>Note</strong>: If you're familiar with the Drive API, the file ID is the ID of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files/get">File</a> resource.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Use a Drive file to <a href="/docs/aodocs-staging.altirnao.com/1/c/Guides/30-Manage%20AODocs%20documents/20-Create,%20modify,%20delete%20documents/10-Create%20new%20documents%20with%20attachments/20-Create%20new%20document%20and%20attach%20Drive%20file">create a new AODocs document with an attachment</a>.</p>
