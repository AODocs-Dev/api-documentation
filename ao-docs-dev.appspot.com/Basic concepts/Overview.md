# Overview

AODocs APIs let you access, manage, and configure AODocs objects and their associated metadata, such as libraries, classes, documents, attachments, and properties.

The APIs also let you interact indirectly with some AODocs-related Google Drive API functionality, including accessing files and folders in Drive.
