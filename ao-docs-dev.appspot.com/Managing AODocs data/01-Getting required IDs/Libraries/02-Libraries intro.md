# Get AODocs library info (list all available libraries)

AODocs content is contained in libraries.  Your libraries should already exist; if they don't, a library administrator needs to [create them first](https://support.aodocs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002366923-Create-a-library-from-scratch).

Once your libraries exist, you can list them to get an idea of where to place your content.

The most useful methods to list and get libraries are the following:

* [List all available AODocs libraries (full)](../03-List%20all%20libraries)
* [List all available AODocs libraries (plain)](#heading=h.l3tpn8bxn8c)
* [Get a specific library](#heading=h.sgixsybfrj2a)
