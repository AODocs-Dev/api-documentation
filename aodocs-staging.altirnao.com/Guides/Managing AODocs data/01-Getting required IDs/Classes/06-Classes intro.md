# Get class info

Libraries contain documents of various **types**. These document types, defined ahead of time, are called **[classes](https://support.aodocs.com/hc/en-us/articles/205655634)**. When a library is first created, it automatically gets outfitted with a default document type, or class. Other classes in your target library might already have been created for you.

These methods are useful when working with classes:

* [List all available AODocs classes in a specific library](#heading=h.z5cmdwh1c18a)
* [Get a specific class](#heading=h.z5cmdwh1c18a)
