# Getting Started
---

## Before you begin
You should have access to an AODocs instance and understand some fundamentals about [AODocs](/src/Fundamentals/Basics\ of\ AODocs.md), RESTful APIs in general, and AODocs APIs.

## Using the API

To ease into the world of API calls, you can play around with the API Explorer.  To make it even easier, you can use individual methods in the Managing AODocs data section.  They are arranged on purpose in a sequence that gets you comfortable with the concepts of manipulating AODocs resources.

Or you can dive right into the methods and schemas in the [Reference](https://api.aodocs-staging.com/docs/aodocs-staging.altirnao.com/1/overview).  To flesh out the succinct approach of the reference documentation, you can read up more on AODocs resources and APIs of note in their respective sections.

Additionally, you can explore the Errors/Troubleshooting/Best practices/Performance improvement sections get a better understanding of what's around the edges of the mainstream use cases.

But the easiest way to start is to use the API Explorer to follow the sequence of methods in the Managing AODocs data section.  Here's to learning new and exciting things.
