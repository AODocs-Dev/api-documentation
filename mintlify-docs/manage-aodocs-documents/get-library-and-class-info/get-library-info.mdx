AODocs content is contained in libraries. Your libraries should already exist; if they don’t, a library administrator needs to [create them first](https://support.aodocs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002366923-Create-a-library-from-scratch).

Once your libraries exist, you can list them to get an idea of where to place your content.

The most useful methods to list and get libraries are the following:

<Columns cols={2}>
<Card title="List libraries (legacy v1)" icon="list" horizontal href="/api-reference/library" />
<Card title="List and search libraries (v2beta1)" icon="search" horizontal href="/api-reference/library" />
<Card title="List libraries plain (alternative to List libraries)" icon="list" horizontal href="/api-reference/library" />
<Card title="Get a specific library by ID (alternative to List libraries)" icon="book" horizontal href="/api-reference/library" />
</Columns>

What follows are elaborations on these methods.
