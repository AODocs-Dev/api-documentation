title: "List libraries plain (alternative to List libraries)"
description: "If you only need the library name and ID in the response, then you can use the plain library list ([ApiPlainLibraryList](/api-reference/library)) as an alternative to the full library list ([ApiLibraryList](/api-reference/library)). It is usually much faster than the standard library list API method, but returns much less information."
