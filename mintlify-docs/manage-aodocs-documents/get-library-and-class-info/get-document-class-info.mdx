description: "Libraries contain documents of various types. These document types, defined ahead of time, are called [classes](https://support.aodocs.com/hc/en-us/articles/205655634) . When a library is first created, it automatically gets outfitted with a default document type, or class. Other classes in your target library might already have been created for you."
