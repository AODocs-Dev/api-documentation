## Method and API

Play with the API Explorer:

<Card title="DELETE /document/v1/\{documentId\}" icon="trash" horizontal href="/api-reference/documentid" />

## Guidelines

### Request

Only `documentId` is mandatory, and it must be an AODocs `documentId` not a Drive `fileId`.


<Note>
**Note:**

To get an AODocs document (including its `documentId`) by the Drive ID of one of its attachments, use the `GET /document/v1/drive/{driveId}` method.
</Note>
