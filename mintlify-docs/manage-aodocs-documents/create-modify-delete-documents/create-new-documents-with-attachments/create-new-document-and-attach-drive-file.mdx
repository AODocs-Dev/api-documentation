description: "When you create a TF/SF document, you must attach one and only one attachment (using a Drive file’s fileId ). You create a DMS document the same way, but you can do it with any number of attachments (including zero)."

For example, you might have a spreadsheet in Google Drive that you want to manage with AODocs. Wrapping a new AODocs document around your spreadsheet allows you to use all the AODocs document management features and properties like custom properties and workflows.

In DMS, you can also create a new document with no attachments. An example could be an expense-report document that needs to be delivered before the expenses are ready to be attached. You can create the document first, and then attach the receipts whenever appropriate.

To get familiar with document creation, try to [create AODocs documents in the UI](https://support.aodocs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005892403-Create-AODocs-documents) .

To create a new document with AODocs APIs, send a request to the server with an `ApiDocument` resource, listing:

- mandatory resource fields required by the server (like target library ID)
- optional but useful fields (like document title, class ID, and folder ID)
- any Drive IDs of files to attach — zero or more for DMS libraries; and a mandatory single one for TF/SF
