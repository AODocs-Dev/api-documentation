title: "Before creating AODocs documents: Create test Drive folder and files"
description: "In order to have some test files and folders to work with, open up your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and create a Drive folder. Upload or create some files beside it as well as inside it."
---

Here’s an example of what that might look like:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/drive-new-folder.png" alt="Drive new folder" />
</Frame>
<br/>

<Frame>
<img src="/images/drive-new-file.png" alt="Drive new file" />
</Frame>

## Folder ID

In Drive, files and folders are identified by their individual IDs. When the URL says something like `/drive/folders/**1HczxnMexotWE3H9z8aebZepvkla60UEzz**`, the long string of numbers and letters refers to the current Drive **folder ID**:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/folder-id-in-url-1.png" alt="Folder ID in URL 1" />
</Frame>
<br/>
<Frame>
<img src="/images/folder-id-in-url-2.png" alt="Folder ID in URL 2" />
</Frame>

Make note of the **Drive folder ID** in the URL for later.

## File ID

To get the URL to display the **file** ID of the **file** that’s currently open, click on the More options" menu (**⁝**), then on “Open in new window”:

<Frame>
<img src="/images/file-id-open-in-new-window-menu.png" alt="File ID open in new window menu" />
</Frame>

Now the URL lists the Drive **file** ID (as opposed to **folder** ID):

<Frame>
<img src="/images/file-id-in-ui.png" alt="File ID in UI" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Note**: 

Certain Drive files such as Google Forms require an additional step of clicking on `Edit` (pencil icon usually in the bottom right of the page) and open the file in yet another view. Only then does the URL display the proper file ID.
</Note>

Make note of the **Drive file ID**: it and the **AODocs document ID** are the two most critical and commonly used pieces of identifying information in the **AODocs API**.

<Note>
**Note**: 

If you’re familiar with the Drive API, the file ID is the ID of the [File](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files/get) resource.
</Note>
