## **Usage/notes/guidelines**


### **Request**

`libraryId` is a path parameter. It is the only mandatory parameter. However, using the `classId` helps narrow the response to documents of a specific class you want.

<RequestExample>
```yaml Sample request
POST https://aodocs.altirnao.com/api/search/v1/libraries/RrVcEFb8wtDeNAnlmNN/count?classId=RrVcdN280MKJwPyE7sh
```
</RequestExample>

## Response

The response returns an [ApiDocumentCount](/api-reference/search) resource, giving a count of all documents associated with the specified library (and class if you specified the `classId`).

<ResponseExample>
```json Sample Response
{
  "kind": "aodocs#documentCount",
  "count": 12
}
```
</ResponseExample>
