## AODocs REST API documentation project

This repository contains the documentation for the AODocs REST API.

This project will keep improving over time, it contains only the documentation for basic use cases for now.

You can start by exploring the documentation [in the wiki of this project](https://github.com/AODocs-Dev/api-documentation/wiki), and experiment with your preferred API tools like Postman or your IDE.

If you want to go further, you can request access to the API explorer and the API assets (Open API specification, Java API client), [by filling this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pN0ATXYmstIvNcMbCxwl7UT0EDaTm3VnmoGXyMKXj0o/edit). You must have a valid AODocs license for your domain to get access.

If you are ready to start integrating with the AODocs API, and want to use our API using standard Google OAuth2 (as opposed to the easy-to-use but less secure Security Keys), [please fill this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16AaxpdRwqfUK32InlfU7HinCNlOqAT2k_McQvrdH_fs/edit) to have you client id whitelisted (we usually respond within 3 business days).

We always appreciate feedback, so if you have something to say about this documentation, [please fill this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z40DOiMXIUt5XWzIn4NerABpyk4wJ65XVHVDCjRLYbE/edit)!
