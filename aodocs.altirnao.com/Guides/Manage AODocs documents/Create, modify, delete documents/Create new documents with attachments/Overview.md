# Creating new AODocs documents

In AODocs, you can create new documents with either just a single attachment (TF/SF/DMS), or any number of attachments including zero (DMS-only).

To create AODocs documents with and without attachments, follow these steps:

* [Get a few Drive test files and folders ready (to become AODocs document attachments)](/docs/aodocs.altirnao.com/1/c/Guides/Manage%20AODocs%20documents/Create,%20modify,%20delete%20documents/Create%20new%20documents%20with%20attachments/Create%20test%20Drive%20files%20and%20folders)
* [Create a new document and attach a Drive file](/docs/aodocs.altirnao.com/1/c/Guides/Manage%20AODocs%20documents/Create,%20modify,%20delete%20documents/Create%20new%20documents%20with%20attachments/Create%20new%20document%20and%20attach%20Drive%20file)
